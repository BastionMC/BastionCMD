<p align="center"><strong>A command-line tool for creating projects written with Bastion libraries and frameworks, updating said projects, and much more!</strong></p>
We have created BastionCMD so that you can simply use our tools in one convenient console application. Why have a ton of seperate tools, when you can have them all in one neat package?
